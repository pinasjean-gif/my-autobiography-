    <h1>My Autobiography</h1>
    <hr>

    <p><b>Life is a journey full of dreams and lessons that guide us and help us to grow</b>. Everyone has a story and mine is still in the progress as I continue each day and I am the person with big hopes for my future. My name is <b>Jean V. Piñas</b>, I just recently <b>turned 19 last October 12</b>. I live in <b>Bankal, Lapu-Lapu City</b>. I am currently studying at <b>Lapu-Lapu City College</b> as an <b>Information Technology</b> student. Being a student is not always easy but I am willing to work hard because I know this will help me reach my dreams.</p>

    <p>I am the <b>youngest child among three siblings</b>. Growing up I experienced both being cared for and also being challenged to prove myself. I have <b>always love animals</b>, <b>especially cats</b> because they make me feel happy and relaxed whenever I play with them. Aside from that, I also enjoy <b>reading fiction books</b> and <b>watching dramas</b>. These simple hobbies are my stress relievers whenever I feel tired or bored. It also give me ideas, lessons and inspiration that I carry in my daily life.</p>

    <p>I also love exploring new things because I believe learning does not only happen in school but also through experiences. Every new challenge or opportunity I face helps me grow and discover more about myself. <b>My biggest goal is to finish my studies, so I can be successful in the future</b>. I want to show people especially my family that I can achieve my dreams. I want them to feel proud of me and see that all their sacrifices are worth it.</p>

    <p>My life is a journey filled with lessons, challenges and dreams. As days, months or years may pass I am more eager to keep striving and learning. Life may not always be easy but I believe that with patience and determination, I will reach the future that I have been hoping for. <b>This is who I am and I will continue to do my best until I make my dreams come true.</b></p>
